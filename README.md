# Manul_team
A team for the first hackathon of TUM campus Heilbronn

## Quick start (Streamlit)
- Install deps inside the venv if needed: `pip install streamlit pandas`.
- Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`.
- Put your CSV files in `data/` or upload one from the sidebar to see an instant preview and charts.

## Real-time delay monitor
- A new multi-page entry **UrbanPulse: DB Impact Monitor** shows live departures for key German hubs, colors them by delay, and draws rail links on a folium map.
- Start the Streamlit app as above and pick the UrbanPulse page from the sidebar page selector.
